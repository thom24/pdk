Functional description
----------------------

The ex04_linux_baremetal_2core_echo_test mainly initializes an rpmsg receive node and sends an announcment message to advertize the receive node.
After initialization the application mainly executes the responder function which waits for a "ping" message and sends a "pong" message back
to the source.
