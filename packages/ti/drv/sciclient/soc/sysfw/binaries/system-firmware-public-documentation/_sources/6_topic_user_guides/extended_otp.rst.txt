==================================
 Using Extended OTP on HS devices
==================================

K3 family of devices have a set of one-time programmable(OTP) efuses to carry
root of trust keys and other information used during device boot. The purpose of
these efuses is fixed. K3 family of devices have another set of OTP efuses for
general purpose use by the customer. We refer to these efuses as extended OTP.
In this document, we describe how the extended OTP can be accessed through TISCI
API. This document must be read along side

1. :doc:`../2_tisci_msgs/security/extended_otp` and
2. :doc:`../3_boardcfg/BOARDCFG_SEC`, specifically :ref:`pub_boardcfg_ext_otp_config`

.. note::

   The API in this document deal only with the extended OTP area.
   They do not access the predefined key area containing
   the root of trust keys.

.. note::

   This document is only applicable to HS devices.

Hardware Configuration
========================

The extended OTP area can have a maximum of 1024 bits. The extended OTP area is
organized into rows of bits. The width of each row can vary based on the device.
Please refer to the :ref:`pub_soc_family_doc` for the below details.

- number of bits available in the OTP area
- Width of the OTP rows

On device boot, the data in the OTP area is read into a set of 32 bit memory
mapped registers(MMRs). There are 32 such registers to accommodate the maximum
number of OTP bits. The width of these registers is always 32 bits irrespective
of width of the underlying hardware OTP rows. These registers are only refreshed
on a POR of the device and not on a warm reset.

The hardware allows each individual OTP row (not MMR) to be locked to prevent
modification. Once the OTP row is locked, any bit in the row can never be
modified.

Programming the extended OTP
============================

TI provides two pieces of software to program the extended OTP area.

1. Key Writer - Key Writer is used in the factory for programming the customer
   root of trust keys, key revision and key count on a HS Field Securable(FS)
   Device. It can be used to program the extended OTP area at the same time.
   Once the key revision and key count are programmed a HS FS device becomes HS
   Security Enforced(SE) device. Key Writer does not run on a HS SE device.

2. System Firmware - System Firmware provides API that can be used to access and
   modify the extended OTP area on a HS SE device for all SoCs. It provides these
   APIs on HS FS and GP device also for AM64x, AM62x and AM62Ax SoCs. System 
   Firmware is not a standalone executable and must be used along with software 
   running on another core to access or modify the extended OTP area.

In this document, we describe how to use |sysfw| to access/modify the extended
OTP area.

.. note::

   Key Writer and |sysfw| are independent software deliveries. Please contact TI
   Support for information on the Key Writer.

The |sysfw| TISCI messages for OTP access are in two categories due to the
granularity at which they work.

1. Read - Works on MMR granularity (32 bit)
2. Write/Lock - Works on row granularity (hardware dependent)

The reasons for the different granularity are

1. |sysfw| does not maintain state across device reboots. Any write protection
   performed must be tied to the hardware. Hardware provides write protection at
   row granularity. Therefore the write/lock API must operate at a row granularity.

2. We expect the OTP read operation to be performed more often compared to the
   OTP write operation. We expect most data stored in the OTP area to be a
   multiple of 32 bit width. If it is smaller, it could be easily extracted from
   32 bit data with bit operations. So |sysfw| offers a read API with 32 bit
   granularity instead of the underlying row width.


Extended OTP Read API
=====================

|sysfw| allows specifying access permissions for each 32 bit MMR through the
|sec_bcfg|. Each row can be assigned a host ID as an owner and be specified as
secure or non-secure. See :ref:`pub_boardcfg_otp_entry`.

**Secure vs. non-secure** - Marking a row as non-secure implies that |sysfw| can
provide the value of the 32-bit MMR as a response to the TISCI read message. If
a row is marked secure, the 32-bit MMR value will not be returned in the TISCI
response message. The MMR value can only be used to setup encryption or
decryption contexts for processing data.

If a row is assigned to a single host, the MMR can be read only by that host. To
allow multiple hosts to read the MMR, the host ID must be set to 128. If the MMR
must not be accessible to any host, the host ID must be set to 0.

If a row is marked as non-secure, the owning host can read the MMR by using the
:ref:`TISCI_MSG_READ_OTP_MMR <sec-api-ext-otp-read-otp-mmr>` message.

.. _extended-otp-write-api:

Extended OTP Write API
======================

|sysfw| allows for only one host in the system to have write access to the
extended OTP region. This host is specified in the security board configuration
:ref:`pub_boardcfg_ext_otp_config` using the ``write_host`` field.

The write host can write to any row that has not been locked using the
:ref:`TISCI_MSG_WRITE_OTP_ROW <write-otp-row>` message. The API takes a bit mask
in addition to the value to be written. This allows single bits to modified if
necessary.

The write host can perform a soft write lock using the 
:ref:`TISCI_MSG_SOFT_LOCK_OTP_WRITE_GLOBAL <soft-lock-otp-write-global>` message to prevent
further writes to OTP until a warm/cold reset of the device. A soft write lock prevents
even the write host from performing further writes until the next reset.

The write host can also lock a row permanently using the 
:ref:`TISCI_MSG_LOCK_OTP_ROW <lock-otp-row>` message. This prevents any further modifications
to the row even after a device cold/warm reset.

The lock status of a row can be queried using the
:ref:`TISCI_MSG_GET_OTP_ROW_LOCK_STATUS <get-otp-row-lock-status>` message.
