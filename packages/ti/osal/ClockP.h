 *  @brief      Clock module for the RTOS Porting Interface. This implements
 *              the software timer support. For hardware timer support, please
 *              check TimerP.h
 *  
 *  The ClockP module can be used to create a software (OS) timer and configure 
 *  it to invoke a User callback when timer expires.
 *
 *  The timer can be configured as a one-shot or a continuous mode timer.
